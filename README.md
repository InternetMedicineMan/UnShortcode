UnShortcode
===========

UnShortcode Plugin for WordPress

Designed as a replacement to the difficult to remember, difficult to use, difficult to visualize shortcodes that are very popular for WordPress. There is a better way. Plugins have access to the CSS Style sheets for the WYSIWYG, this plugin adds button styling and a pop up form to allow additions of the buttons in visual form directly into the WYSIWYG.

A happy side effect we found after creating the plugin was when we keep the code very simple, after you add a button, you can edit the text, the link, the title right inside the WYSIWYG as you can regular text. The only reason you'd need to delete it and re-add the button is to change colors or styling.
